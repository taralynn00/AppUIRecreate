Homework assignment for CIS 357 01; Goal: Recreate the UI of my favorite app.

---

**Instructions:**
1. Pick one favorite iOS/Android app of your choice

2. If your favorite app has multiple screens, pick one of screens. Take a screenshot of the selected screen.

3. Send the image to yourself, so you can save a copy of the image

4. Create a new Android Studio Compose project to clone the UI of your favorite app. Recreate the UI of your favorite app using Android Jetpack Compose. You need to replicate only the UI appearance (color, shape, layout, etc.). You are not required to make the UI functional. (i.e. clicks on a button has no effect, toggling a switch has no effect on the rest of the UI).

5. The clone app must include at least one widget from each of the following groups (except for Group 5)

* Group 1 (3 points): Text, TextField
* Group 2 (3 points): Image, Icon
* Group 3 (3 points): Slider, CheckBox, Linear/Circular Progress, RadioButton, Switch
* Group 4 (3 points) Button, IconButton
* Group 5 (5 points): Row, Column, Box (must include at least two)
* Group 6 (5 points): use 5 different widget modifiers across the app
TIP
If your favorite app lacks widgets from Group 1-4 above, you can add a widget of your choice. It is acceptable four your clone to have more widgets (rather than fewer) than the original.

Refer to the catalog of Android Jetpack Compose components for more details.

6. (-2 points if missing) Include your name somewhere in the UI

7. Push your Android Studio project to a private GitHub repository.

**Clone Resemblance To Original:** 
Your clone app will also be evaluated for how well it replicates the original UI. <br>

5 points when the clone shows UI widgets and layout which is similar to the original <br>
3 points when the clone has minor issues with layout but replicate at least 70% of original UI <br>
1 points when the clone shows major issues with layout and replicate at least 40% of the original UI <br>

**Extra Credit:**
1. (4 points) Select a second screen in your favorite app
2. (4 points) Organize the first screen (above) and the second screen using Tabs

**Upload the following to Bb:**
* (-5 points if missing) The screenshot of the original iOS/Android app you chose
* (3 points) A screenshot of the UI recreated on Android Studio
* (-3 points if missing) The URL to your Git repository
